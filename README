To do:
   * Abstract some of the containers on the advanced search page
   * Add a non-rounded box type.  Use it for containers
   * Do as much spacing/padding/margins there as possible

   * Label things on the forms page

   * Create an 'advanced seach page' vs. 'advanced search results page'

   * Label the newcolor's and add them to the guide.  re-rationalize numbering then.
