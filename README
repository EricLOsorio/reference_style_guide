To do:
   * You need to build a couple rails forms so you know how they get built and styled 
   * Label things on the forms page

   * Do as much spacing/padding/margins in containers as possible (no padding/margins elsewhere)
   * look for mixins.  Those are examples of hierarchy


   * Geoff's remark: "It would be helpful to see thumbnails of the thing getting used in various 
     contexts."  If one of the uses of this is to help new designers learn the visual language, then
     I agree, it'd be good to help annotate this with more usage guidelines

   * Issue: give a generic version with names?  Or give a realistic versions, and somehow give sidebar
     commentary?
