To do:
   * You need to build a couple rails forms so you know how they get built and styled 
   * Label things on the forms page

   * Do as much spacing/padding/margins in containers as possible (no padding/margins elsewhere)
   * Create an 'advanced seach page' vs. 'advanced search results page'
   * look for mixins.  Those are examples of hierarchy
